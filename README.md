# Credit Risk Modelling Project

## Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks and associated data for a comprehensive credit risk modeling project. The project covers the development and implementation of models for Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL).

## Project Structure
- `data_preparation.ipynb`: General data preparation steps applicable across the different models.
- `PD_data_pre.ipynb`: Notebook for preprocessing the data used in PD models.
- `PD_model.ipynb`: Contains the modeling process for Probability of Default.
- `PD_Monitoring.ipynb`: Monitoring and performance evaluation of the PD model.
- `data_LGD_EAD.ipynb`: Data preparation and initial analysis for LGD and EAD models.
- `LGD_EAD_CECL_Model.ipynb`: Combined modeling notebook for LGD, EAD, and CECL calculations.
